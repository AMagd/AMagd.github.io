  <strong>ABOUT ME</strong><br>
    I am a PhD student at Simon Fraser University's School of Computing Science, working with Professor <a href="https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=kYqRtJAAAAAJ">Sharan Vaswani</a> on theoretically principled reinforcement learning. Previously, I built RL systems for real-world robot manipulation as a machine learning engineer at <a href="https://plaif.com/">PLAIF</a>, explored generative models and RL for medical imaging as a research intern with Johns Hopkins University's <a href="https://ccvl.jhu.edu/">CCVL Lab</a>, and investigated RL and generative models at KAIST's Machine Learning and Mind Lab led by Professor <a href="https://mlml.kaist.ac.kr/sungjinahn">Sungjin Ahn</a>. I also completed an MS in AI & Robotics at KAIST, developing diffusion-model perception for autonomous driving under Professor <a href="http://vdclab.kaist.ac.kr/bbs/board.php?bo_table=sub1_1">Dongsuk Kum</a>.

<!-- 
    Currently doing a research internship at Johns Hopkins University with <a href="https://ccvl.jhu.edu/">CCVL Lab</a> focusing on the development of generative models and reinforcement learning algorithms for medical images. Prior to that I worked as a researcher at KAIST's School of Computing and part of the Machine Learning and Mind Lab led by Professor <a href="https://mlml.kaist.ac.kr/sungjinahn">Sungjin Ahn</a> with a focus on reinforcement learning and generative models. Previously, I completed my MS in Robotics at KAIST, focusing on Machine Learning and Computer Vision for self-driving cars under Professor <a href="http://vdclab.kaist.ac.kr/bbs/board.php?bo_table=sub1_1">Dongsuk Kum</a>. My research spans the improvement of reinforcement learning, generative models and computer vision algorithms in application related to embodied agents (e.g. robotics, simulation environments like Memoy Maze, DMC, etc.). -->
