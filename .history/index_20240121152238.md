  <strong>ABOUT ME</strong>
  <p>
    Currently a researcher at KAIST's School of Computing and part of the Machine Learning and Mind Lab led by Professor <a href="https://mlml.kaist.ac.kr/sungjinahn">Sungjin Ahn</a>. Previously, I completed my MS in Robotics at KAIST, focusing on Machine Learning and Computer Vision for self-driving cars under Professor <a href="http://vdclab.kaist.ac.kr/bbs/board.php?bo_table=sub1_1">Dongsuk Kum</a>. My research spans the improvement of reinforcement learning, generative models, computer vision and their application in AI agents, specifically for embodied agents (e.g. robotics, simulation environments like Memoy Maze, DMC, etc.).
