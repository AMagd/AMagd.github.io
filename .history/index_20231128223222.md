	<strong> ABOUT ME </strong>
	<p>Last July I graduated from KAIST while doing a MS in Robotics focused on Machine Learning and Computer Vision in VDC Lab, under the supervision of professor <a href="http://vdclab.kaist.ac.kr/bbs/board.php?bo_table=sub1_1">Dongsuk Kum</a> and currently I am a researcher at KAIST in the school of computing department in the Machine Learning and Mind Lab under professor <a href="https://mlml.kaist.ac.kr/sungjinahn">Sungjin Ahn</a>. Currently I am a member of the perception team at <a href="http://vdclab.kaist.ac.kr/"> VDC</a> Lab. My current research focuses is on improving machine learning algorithms, specifically reinforcement learning and computer vision for general purpose AI agents. My master thesis was about the use of diffusion models for mapping the surrouning environment of a self-driving cars. And since graduation I worked on reinforcement learning and sequence models (e.g. S4, Transformers, RNNs, and others), in addition to diffusion as well (basically work related to Diffuser). So basically I am interested in this area that couples diffusion models, sequence models and reinforcment learning to improve embodied agents capabilities of modeling their environment and acting there
