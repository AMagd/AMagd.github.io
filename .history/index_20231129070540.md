  <strong> ABOUT ME </strong>
  <p>
    I am currently a researcher at KAIST in the School of Computing, part of the Machine Learning and Mind Lab under Professor <a href="https://mlml.kaist.ac.kr/sungjinahn">Sungjin Ahn</a>. My work focuses on advancing machine learning algorithms, notably in reinforcement learning and computer vision, aimed at developing general-purpose AI agents. I'm also a member of the Perception Team at VDC Lab, under the supervision of Professor <a href="http://vdclab.kaist.ac.kr/bbs/board.php?bo_table=sub1_1">Dongsuk Kum</a>.

    My academic journey led me to graduate from KAIST last July with an MS in Robotics, where my master thesis explored the use of diffusion models for environmental mapping in self-driving cars. Post-graduation, my research expanded to include reinforcement learning and sequence models such as S4, Transformers, and RNNs, along with continued work on diffusion models, particularly in the context of Diffuser. My current research aims to integrate diffusion models, sequence models, and reinforcement learning to enhance the environmental modeling and decision-making abilities of embodied agents.
