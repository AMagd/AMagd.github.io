  <strong>ABOUT ME</strong><br>
    Currently a machine learning engineer at <a href="https://plaif.com/">PLAIF</a> working on reinforcement learning for real robot manipulation. prior to that I was a research intern at Johns Hopkins University <a href="https://ccvl.jhu.edu/">CCVL Lab</a>, focusing on generative models and reinforcement learning for medical images, and a researcher at KAIST's School of Computing in the Machine Learning and Mind Lab led by Professor <a href="https://mlml.kaist.ac.kr/sungjinahn">Sungjin Ahn</a>, working on reinforcement learning and generative models. I hold an MS in AI & Robotics from KAIST, where I worked on diffusion models with computer vision for self-driving cars under Professor <a href="http://vdclab.kaist.ac.kr/bbs/board.php?bo_table=sub1_1">Dongsuk Kum</a>. My work generally spans the enhancement of reinforcement learning, generative models, for embodied agents (e.g. robotics, simulation environments like Memoy Maze, DMC, etc.).

    Currently doing a research internship at Johns Hopkins University with <a href="https://ccvl.jhu.edu/">CCVL Lab</a> focusing on the development of generative models and reinforcement learning algorithms for medical images. Prior to that I worked as a researcher at KAIST's School of Computing and part of the Machine Learning and Mind Lab led by Professor <a href="https://mlml.kaist.ac.kr/sungjinahn">Sungjin Ahn</a> with a focus on reinforcement learning and generative models. Previously, I completed my MS in Robotics at KAIST, focusing on Machine Learning and Computer Vision for self-driving cars under Professor <a href="http://vdclab.kaist.ac.kr/bbs/board.php?bo_table=sub1_1">Dongsuk Kum</a>. My research spans the improvement of reinforcement learning, generative models and computer vision algorithms in application related to embodied agents (e.g. robotics, simulation environments like Memoy Maze, DMC, etc.). -->
